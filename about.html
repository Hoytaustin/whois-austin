    <div class="box4">Climbing can be anything you want it to be! From climbing stairs to climbing mountains, there are so many different ways to climb. This site focuses on my, Austin Hoyt’s, climbing journey in the discipline of bouldering. Bouldering is the form of climbing in which you carry foam pads out to a boulder that is usually around 15-25 feet tall and try to climb into the top without falling.</div>
    <div class="box5">I climb A LOT. I have traveled around the world to climb at different locations. Most recently, last summer I visited South Africa for five weeks just to boulder. My main goal was to climb the hardest possible boulders I could. Bouldering has a grading scale which measures the difficulty of a certain boulder, ranging from v0 being the easiest to v17 being the hardest. While in Africa I managed to climb a boulder named “Monkey Wedding” that is graded v15, making it one of the hardest in the world and my personal hardest to date!</div>
    <div class="box6">I strive to be a professional climber one day. While it does seem difficult to achieve, it is totally possible. I already have a few sponsors who support me, but in the future the dream is to be able to make a living. While climbing is my true passion, I also enjoy filmmaking. I plan on merging the two sometime in the future and create my own media/production company!</div>
